## SQL Data Transformation & Analysis Project

This project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

### Key Skills:

- SQL DDL & DML
- Joins & subqueries
- Window functions
- Aggregations
- Data integrity
- Reporting

### Summary:

This project was built using PostgreSQL to clean, model, and analyze transactional data.

I used a combination of SQL window functions and common table expressions (CTEs) to produce clean, actionable reporting outputs.

**Repository coming soon!**
