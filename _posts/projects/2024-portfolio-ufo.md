## UFO Sightings & CDC Birth Analysis

This project uses SQL, Python, and API scraping to analyze correlations between US UFO sighting reports and US birth statistics (CDC data).

### Key Skills:

- Data Extraction (APIs & scraping)
- ETL pipeline
- SQL development
- Data cleaning & wrangling
- Data visualization
- Hypothesis testing

### Summary:

I built an ETL pipeline to gather UFO sighting data from open APIs and matched it with CDC birth records.

The project explores whether there is any seasonal or regional correlation between reported UFO activity and birth rates.

**Full notebook and analysis coming soon!**
