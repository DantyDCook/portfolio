## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between UFO sightings in the United States and CDC birth rates, using data wrangling, visualization, and statistical correlation techniques.

I combined open UFO sighting records with CDC birth data and performed exploratory data analysis, trend visualization, and initial hypothesis testing.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data Wrangling & Cleaning
- Visualization

## Outcome

Found that although there are interesting local patterns, there is no statistically significant national correlation between UFO reports and birth rates. The project showcases my data acquisition, wrangling, and visualization skills.
